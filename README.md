# raspi-pir-binary-counter
School project for detecting movements from a PIR sensor and showing the amount of movements on connected LEDs in a binary pattern.  

Connect LEDs to GPIO pins: 7, 8, 25, 24, 23, 18, 15, 14.  
Connect PIR sensor to GPIO pin 17.  

run script and wave your hand in front of the PIR sensor to see the LEDs change.
